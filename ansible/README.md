# Using Ansible for Configuration and Automation

#### Overview
---
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is used to deploy, configure, manage and scale systems.

To use these scripts first install Ansible from here: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html  
**Note:** *Python 2.6 or 2.7 must be installed (Windows isn’t supported for the control machine)*

**Folders:**
* The test_scripts folder contains the scripts I started out with for experimentation.  
* The elastic_monitoring folder is a project intended to be used to start up a remote Azure machine and host the Elastic monitoring tools.
