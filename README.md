# Elastic Monitor

#### Tools to help monitor your Elastic servers

In this project there are two tools that can serve as an alternative to the monitoring tools Elastic already comes. 

1. Analytics Dashboard - A web app that displays your server statistics/details to keep you informed on your server status
